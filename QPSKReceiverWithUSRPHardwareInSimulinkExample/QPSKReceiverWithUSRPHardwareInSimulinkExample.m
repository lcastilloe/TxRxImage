%% QPSK Receiver with USRP Hardware in Simulink
% This model shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(TM)
% (USRP) device with Simulink(R) to implement a QPSK receiver. The receiver
% addresses practical issues in wireless communications, e.g. carrier
% frequency and phase offset, timing offset and frame synchronization. This
% model receives the signal sent by the 
% <docid:usrpradio_ug#example-sdruqpsktx QPSK Transmitter with USRPâ„¢ Hardware in Simulink>
% example at bit rate of 1 Mbps. The
% receiver demodulates the received symbols and outputs a simple message to
% the MATLAB(R) command line.
% 
% In order to run this model, you need to ensure that the specified center
% frequency of the USRP Receiver is within the acceptable range of your
% USRP daughter board.

%% Overview
% This model performs all processing at complex baseband to handle a
% time-varying frequency offset, a time-varying symbol delay, and Gaussian
% noise. To cope with the above-mentioned impairments, this example
% provides a reference design of a practical digital receiver, which
% includes correlation-based coarse frequency compensation, symbol timing
% recovery with fixed-rate resampling and bit stuffing/skipping, fine
% frequency compensation, frame synchronization and phase ambiguity
% resolution. The example uses some key algorithms in MATLAB,
% emphasizing textual algorithm expression over graphical algorithm
% expression.

% The components are further described in the following sections.
%
% * *AGC* - Automatic gain control 
% * *Raised Cosine Receive Filter* - Uses a rolloff factor of 0.5
% * *Coarse Frequency Compensation* - Estimates an approximate frequency
% offset of the received signal and corrects it
% * *Symbol Synchronizer* - Resamples the input signal according to a
% recovered timing strobe so that symbol decisions are made at the optimum
% sampling instants
% * *Carrier Synchronizer* - Compensates for the residual frequency offset
% and the phase offset
% * *Preamble Detector* - Detect location of the frame header
% * *Frame Synchronizer* - Aligns the frame boundaries at the known
% frame header
% * *Data Decoding* - Resolves the phase ambiguity caused by the *Carrier
% Synchronizer*, demodulates the signal, and decodes the text message
%% Receiver
%% AGC
% The received signal amplitude affects the accuracy of the carrier and
% symbol synchronizer. Therefore the signal amplitude should be stabilized
% to ensure an optimum loop design. The AGC output power is set to a value
% ensuring that the equivalent gains of the phase and timing error
% detectors keep constant over time. The AGC is placed before the *Raised
% Cosine Receive Filter* so that the signal amplitude can be measured with
% an oversampling factor of two, thus improving the accuracy of the
% estimate. You can refer to Chapter 7.2.2 and Chapter 8.4.1 of [ <#16 1> ]
% for details on how to design the phase detector gain.

%% Raised Cosine Receive Filter
% The *Raised Cosine Receive Filter* provides matched filtering for 
% the transmitted waveform with a rolloff factor of 0.5.
%% Coarse Frequency Compensation
% The *Coarse Frequency Compensation* subsystem corrects the input signal
% with a rough estimate of the frequency offset. The following diagram
% shows the subsystem, in which the frequency offset is estimated by
% averaging the output of the correlation-based algorithm of the *Coarse
% Frequency Compensator* block. The compensation is performed by the
% Phase/Frequency Offset block. There is usually a residual frequency
% offset even after the coarse frequency compensation, which would cause a
% slow rotation of the constellation.  The *Carrier Synchronizer* block
% compensates for this residual frequency.
%
% The accuracy of the *Coarse Frequency Compensator* decreases with its
% maximum frequency offset value. Ideally, this value should be set just
% above the expected frequency offset range.
%
open_system([modelname '/QPSK Receiver/Coarse Frequency Compensation']);
%% Symbol Synchronizer
% The timing recovery is performed by a *Symbol Synchronizer* library
% block, which implements a PLL, described in Chapter 8 of [ <#16 1> ], to
% correct the timing error in the received signal. The timing error
% detector is estimated using the Gardner algorithm, which is rotationally
% invariant. In other words, this algorithm can be used before or after
% frequency offset compensation. The input to the block is oversampled by
% two. On average, the block generates one output symbol for every two
% input samples. However, when the channel timing error (delay) reaches symbol 
% boundaries, there will be one extra or missing symbol in the output frame. 
% In that case, the block implements bit stuffing/skipping and generates
% one more or less samples comparing to the desired frame size. So the output
% of this block is a variable-size signal.
%
% The _Damping factor_, _Normalized loop bandwidth_, and _Detector gain_
% parameters of the block are tunable. Their default values are set to 1
% (critical damping), 0.01 and 5.4 respectively, so that the PLL quickly
% locks to the correct timing while introducing little timing jitter.
%% Carrier Synchronizer
% The fine frequency compensation is performed by a *Carrier Synchronizer*
% library block, which implements a phase-locked loop (PLL), described in
% Chapter 7 of [ <#16 1> ], to track the residual frequency offset and the
% phase offset in the input signal. The PLL uses a Direct Digital
% Synthesizer (DDS) to generate the compensating phase that offsets the
% residual frequency and phase offsets. The phase offset estimate from DDS
% is the integral of the phase error output of a Loop Filter.
%
% The _Damping factor_ and _Normalized loop bandwidth_ parameters of the
% block are tunable. Their default values are set to 1 (critical damping)
% and 0.01 respectively, so that the PLL quickly locks to the intended
% phase while introducing little phase noise.
%% Frame Synchronizer
% The preamble detection and frame synchronization is performed by a MATLAB
% System block using a *FrameSynchronizer* System object. The Preamble
% Detector uses the known frame header (QPSK-modulated Barker code)
% to correlate against the received QPSK symbols in order to find the
% location of the frame header. The Frame Synchronizer block uses this
% location information to align the frame boundaries. It also transforms
% the variable-size output of the *Symbol Synchronizer* block into a
% fixed-size frame, which is necessary for the downstream processing. 
% The second output of the block is a Boolean scalar indicating
% if the first output is a valid frame with the desired header and if so,
% enables the *Data Decoding* subsystem to run.
%% Data Decoding
% The *Data Decoding* enabled subsystem performs phase ambiguity
% resolution, demodulation and text message decoding. The *Carrier
% Synchronizer* block may lock to the unmodulated carrier with a phase
% shift of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, which can cause a phase ambiguity.
% For details of phase ambiguity and its resolution, please refer to
% Chapter 7.2.2 and 7.7 in [ <#16 1> ]. The *Phase Offset Estimator*
% subsystem determines this phase shift. The *Phase Ambiguity Correction &
% Demodulation* subsystem rotates the input signal by the estimated phase
% offset and demodulates the corrected data. The payload bits are
% descrambled, and then decoded. All of the stored bits are converted to 
% characters are printed in the Simulink Diagnostic Viewer.

%% Running the Example
% Before running this model, first start the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareInSimulinkExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktx.slx')
% QPSK Transmitter with USRP Hardware> model.
% 
% This receiver model is capable of handling a frequency offset of 12.5kHz between the transmitter
% and receiver boards. However, when the frequency offset exceeds this range,
% the *Coarse Frequency Compensation* subsystem cannot accurately determine the offset
% of the received signal, which is critical for correct timing recovery and data 
% decoding. We encourage you to run the companion frequency 
% calibration <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/FrequencyOffsetCalibrationUSRPHardwareSimulinkExample','supportingFile','sdrufreqcalib.slx') transmitter> and 
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/FrequencyOffsetCalibrationUSRPHardwareSimulinkExample','supportingFile','sdrufreqcalib_rx.slx') receiver> models with your USRP transmitter
% and receiver hardware to roughly determine the frequency offset between 
% your two USRP boards. With that frequency offset value, you can
% manually adjust the _Center frequency_ of the *USRP Receiver*
% subsystem in the receiver model to ensure a residual frequency offset that 
% the model can track.
% 
% If the received signal is too weak or too strong, you might notice some
% garbled message output. In that case, you can change the gain of either
% the *USRP Transmitter* subsystem in the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareInSimulinkExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktx.slx')
% QPSK Transmitter with USRP Hardware> model or the *USRP Receiver*
% subsystem in the current model for better reception. Please also change
% the preamble detector threshold, in case you may see some recurrent
% garbled message output. This is because when the threshold of the
% preamble detector is set too low, the following steps will try to decode
% the header. When the threshold is set too high, you may not getting any
% outputs.
% 
% To run this model, first turn on the USRP hardware and connect it to
% the computer. Set the _Center frequency_ parameter of the *USRP Receiver*
% block according to the center frequency setting of the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareInSimulinkExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktx.slx')
% QPSK Transmitter with USRP Hardware> model
% and the frequency calibration result. Then run the model. To ensure
% real-time processing, the model is by default set to run in Accelerator
% mode, and to remove all signal visualization. The received messages are
% decoded and printed out in the *View diagnostics* window while the simulation
% is running.

%% Exploring the Example
% The example allows you to experiment with multiple system capabilities to
% examine their effect on bit error rate performance.
%
% You can tune the _Normalized loop bandwidth_ and _Damping factor_
% parameters of the *Symbol Synchronizer* and *Carrier Synchronizer*
% blocks, to assess their convergence time and estimation accuracy. In
% addition, you can assess the pull-in range of the *Carrier Synchronizer*
% block. With a large _Normalized loop bandwidth_ and _Damping factor_, the
% PLL can acquire over a greater frequency offset range. However a large
% _Normalized loop bandwidth_ allows more noise, which leads to a large
% mean squared error in the phase estimation. "Underdamped systems (with
% Damping Factor less than one) have a fast settling time, but exhibit
% overshoot and oscillation; overdamped systems (with Damping Factor
% greater than one) have a slow settling time but no oscillations." [ <#16
% 1> ]. For more detail on the design of these PLL parameters, you can
% refer to Appendix C in [ <#16 1> ].
% 
% You can also tune the Preamble detector threshold and see its effects on
% the output message. If your model does not run in real-time and if you 
% have a <https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html supported compiler> 
% installed on your computer, set the Simulink Simulation Mode to "accelerator" or 
% "Rapid Accelerator" to improve model execution speed and enable real-time operation. 
% If your model is already running in real-time, you can also achieve higher 
% symbol rates. If you change the symbol rate of the receiver, 
% also set the symbol rate of the transmitter model.
